 <h2> 01.02.2025 </h2>
 <p> If we are moots, you'll probably know that I hate coffee. Just kidding! I am literally addicted to coffee. WITH ICE!
     Last December, Bleu Bean offered a loyalty card for those customers who bought Specialty Coffee or Barista Choice. 
     If you're looking for 39-50 pesos worth of coffee, then this is not for you. This kind of coffee is a bit pricey, but really worth it. 
     I usually buy their Premium Coffee which the price ranges from 49-59 pesos, but since they had a loyalty card offered, I bought the pricey one.
     For your fifth buy, you'll receive a mug. And for your tenth or last buy, you'll get a tote bag and 1 free drink!  </p>
 <p> Fast forward, this December I tried my best to get those freebies. I always visit their facebook page to see if their shop is open.
     I only have 1 week left to complete those ten cups because there are days that their shop will be closed due to Holidays. And finally, this January 02,
     I completed the ten cups and got their tote bag! The employee congratulated me.
     Am I worth it to be congratulated? Lol. For a moment, I feel like a normal person. I was living?  </p>
 <p> They have this unique tagline that asks people if ever they are feeling bleu. Yes, I think this cafe is destined for people like me.
     I commend the owner of this shop because they really care about their customers and people's well-being. Actually, I saw how they
     started. I witnessed them grow and I am really proud of them. They now have few branches on different places, waaaaaaaaah. </p>
 <p> Anyway, here's more of my gallery photos. Thereeeeeeeee's moreeeeeee to exploreeeeeee! </p>
